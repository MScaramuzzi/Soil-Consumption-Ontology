## Abstract

Soil consumption is a phenomenon associated with the loss of fundamental environmental assets, due to the artificial occupation of originally natural soil. This issue is being monitored by SNPA (*Sistema Nazionale per la Protezione dell’Ambiente*), and in recent years an ontology was published by ISPRA (*Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale*). This work aims to be a refactor of that ontology, although with a different approach to the matter.​
